	// 3 was measured and rejected (PR #689), so don't re-derive it from the scheduling
	// math alone. Playwright parallelizes by file, and per-suite timings said 3 should
	// win: 165.9s of test time over 9 files, longest 42.7s, so a ~87s makespan at 2
	// workers against ~59s at 3. What actually happened on the runner is that the box is
	// already CPU-saturated, so the third worker mostly inflated the work rather than
	// absorbing it:

	//   workers  E2E step        total test time  slowest single test
	//   2        136-140s        165.9s           15.0s

	//
	// ~11s of mean gain on a ~218s job, bought with 4.6x inflation on the slowest test
	// and a 12s run-to-run spread (vs 4s at 2 workers). With `retries: 0` and a
	// documented Mailpit/GoTrue timing flake, that margin is worth more than the 11s.
